# qb-target-to-ox-target

Currently only supports BoxZones for qb-target but anyone can easily edit it to support much more.

Place any BOXZONE configs into config_target

run the script in-game

all configs will be converted to ox-target format via a client print, you can change it to console.log etc if you wish.

As is, to access it just go to: C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app\logs and search by latest, should be at the bottom.
